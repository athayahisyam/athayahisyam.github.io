Currently I am a student at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia. My main area of interest is educational technology with emphasize in Self Regulated Learning. 

I did my undergraduate studies at [Department of Informatics](https://informatika.unida.gontor.ac.id/), [University of Darussalam Gontor](https://unida.gontor.ac.id/), with thesis supervised by [Shoffin Nahwa Utama, M.Kom.](http://informatika.uin-malang.ac.id/shoffin-nahwa-utama/) and co-supervised by [Triana Harmini, M.Pd.](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=Gx0l9MAAAAAJ&hl=en). At the time I also listed as Teaching Assistant and Laboratory Staff at Laboratory of Software Engineering. My undergraduate thesis entitled: **"Desain dan Implementasi Evaluasi Kinerja Dosen Online (Studi Kasus Departemen Teknik Informatika Universitas Darussalam Gontor)"**.
