I love computer since I was a little kid, my first experience typing 1001 Arabian Nights folklore in Microsoft Word 2003 and playing Tomb Raider: Revelation empowers me to learn technology more. As I enrolled to University of Darussalam Gontor's Department of Informatics, I learnt my First Hello Word in Java and later compiled my first college class project, addition calculator. It was an amazing experience. Designing things useful for simplifying mundane and grinding human tasks.

This passion of mine carried me through my education in UNIDA Gontor. Through my experience in learning programming with various difficulties, as the result of my non-technical background, I was able to learn with various methods, such as documentation-oriented learning, learning by doing and self-regulated learning. And I want to share this experience to people who eager to learn about programming and software engineering. As of today, I continuously sharpen my skills in Web Programming, Python Programming with Data Science Specialization, and Computational Thinking to further my understanding in computing subjects.

I did my undergraduate studies at [the Department of Informatics](https://informatika.unida.gontor.ac.id/), [University of Darussalam Gontor](https://unida.gontor.ac.id/), with thesis supervised by [Shoffin Nahwa Utama, M.T.](http://informatika.uin-malang.ac.id/shoffin-nahwa-utama/) and co-supervised by [Triana Harmini, M.Pd.](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=Gx0l9MAAAAAJ&hl=en). At the time I also listed as Teaching Assistant and Laboratory Staff at Laboratory of Software Engineering. My undergraduate thesis entitled: **"Desain dan implementasi sistem informasi evaluasi kinerja dosen daring (Studi kasus Departemen Teknik Informatika Universitas Darussalam Gontor)"**.

My passion in learning led me to study at [the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia](https://cs.ui.ac.id/). I was a member of [the Distance Learning and Digital Libraries (DL2) laboratory](https://dl2.cs.ui.ac.id/v8/about-us.php) and studied under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Dra. Kasiyah, M.Sc.](https://cs.ui.ac.id/personnel/kasiyah/) and [Prof. Harry Budi Santoso, S.Kom., M.Kom., Ph.D.](https://cs.ui.ac.id/personnel/harry-budi-santoso/) with thesis entitled **"The design of discussion forum for Arabic grammar learning using the Community of Inquiry framework"**. My research focused on the design and conduct of language collaborative online learning. Since e-learning produce huge amount of data, from student discussion texts, activity logs or assignment data, e-learning has a strong connection to data science, which is my "by-the-way" passion. 

I graduated from the Universitas Indonesia on 2023 and since then serving as teaching assistant in the Faculty of Computer Science. I currently employed by [Wikimedia Indonesia](https://wikimedia.or.id/) as the Wikidata Staff, specializing in semantic web technologies (particularly [the Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and its tools), community engagement & development and teaching.
